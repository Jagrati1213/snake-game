## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The game is designed to be responsive, ensuring an optimal gaming experience on various devices and screen sizes.

- **Scoring System:** Keep track of your score as you grow the snake by eating the food. Challenge yourself to achieve the highest score possible.

- **Game Over Modal:** When the game ends, a modal will appear displaying your final score and giving you the option to restart the game.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML:** The structure of the game is defined using HTML to create the layout and elements.

- **CSS:** Styling is applied using CSS to make the game visually appealing and responsive.

- **JavaScript:** The game logic is implemented using JavaScript, controlling the movement of the snake, handling collisions, and updating the score.

## How to Play

1. **Launch the Game:** Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

2. **Start Moving:** Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to navigate the snake.

3. **Eat the Food:** Guide the snake to eat the randomly appearing food to grow longer.

4. **Avoid Collisions:** Be cautious not to collide with the walls or the snake's own body.

5. **Score High:** The longer the snake, the higher your score. Challenge yourself to beat your previous high score.

6. **Game Over:** The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself. A modal will appear with your final score.

7. **Restart:** Click the "Restart" button on the modal to play again.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the game further by tweaking the CSS styles or adjusting the game logic in the JavaScript file (`script.js`). Add your own features, themes, or modifications to make it your own!
